--- Direction of Using Git.

Step 1: Download and install Git: Visit the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the latest version of Git for your operating system. Follow the installation steps to complete the setup process. 

Step 2: Open the terminal or Git Bash (on Windows): You can use either the terminal in your operating system or Git Bash to interact with Git. 

Step 3: Set up Git Configuration: Before you start using Git, you need to configure it. Use the following command to set your username and email:
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 4: Create a new Git repository: Navigate to the directory where you want to create a repository, and use the following command:
$ git init

Step 5: Add files to the repository: You can add files to your repository using the git add command. To add all files in the current directory, use the following command:
$ git add .

Step 6: Commit the changes: After adding files to the repository, you need to commit the changes using the 'git commit' command. Use the following command to commit the changes with a message:
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 7: Connect to a remote repository: You can connect to a remote repository such as GitHub or GitLab using the 'git remote add' command. Use the following command to add a remote repository:
$ git remote add origin git://github.com/user/repo.git

Step 8: Push the changes to the remote repository: To push the changes you made in your local repository to the remote repository, use the following command:
$ git push -u origin master

- (These are the basic steps to get started with Git. You can find more information and additional commands on the official Git documentation (https://git-scm.com/doc).



--- Directions on Using GitHub.

Step 1: Create an account: Go to GitHub.com and sign up for a free account by providing your email address, username, and password.

Step 2: Install Git: In order to use GitHub, you need to have Git installed on your computer. Download the latest version of Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Step 3: Set up Git: Once you have installed Git, open the terminal and run the following command to set up your user name and email:
'git config --global user.name “Your Name”'
'git config --global user.email “your-email@example.com”'

Step 4: Create a repository: To start using GitHub, you need to create a repository. A repository is a place where you can store your code and collaborate with others. You can create a repository by clicking on the “+” sign in the top right corner of the GitHub website and selecting “New repository”.

Step 5: Clone the repository: Once you have created a repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. To do this, go to the repository on the GitHub website and click on the “Clone or download” button. Then, copy the URL of the repository and run the following command in the terminal:
'git clone [repository-url]'

Step 6: Add changes: Now that you have cloned the repository, you can make changes to the code. Once you have made changes, you need to stage them using the following command:
'git add .'

Step 7: Commit changes: After you have staged the changes, you need to commit them using the following command:
'git commit -m “your commit message”'

Step 8: Push changes: Finally, you need to push the changes to the remote repository using the following command:
'git push origin [branch-name]'

Step 9: Collaborate: You can now collaborate with others by sharing the repository with them and working on the code together.

- (This is a basic guide on using GitHub. You can find more information on GitHub and Git by visiting their official websites or by reading related tutorials and articles.)



Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.
